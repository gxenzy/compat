# Voltage Drop Visualization Implementation

## Progress Summary

We have started implementing enhanced visualizations for voltage drop analysis, beginning with the VoltageProfileChart component.

## Implemented Features

### 1. VoltageProfileChart Component

The VoltageProfileChart provides a visual representation of voltage levels throughout the length of a circuit, helping users identify where voltage drop becomes problematic.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive line chart showing voltage vs. distance
- Color-coded sections indicating compliant and non-compliant areas
- Reference lines for maximum allowable voltage drop and supply voltage
- Interactive tooltips showing detailed information at each point
- Dynamic data generation based on circuit parameters
- Theme-aware styling for consistent appearance

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
export function generateVoltageProfileData(
  circuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  voltageDropResult: VoltageDropCalculationResult,
  numberOfPoints: number = 20
): VoltageProfileData[] {
  const supplyVoltage = circuitData.voltage || 230;
  const conductorLength = circuitData.conductorLength || 10;
  const voltageDrop = voltageDropResult.voltageDrop;
  const maxAllowedDrop = voltageDropResult.maxAllowedDrop;
  
  // Calculate maximum voltage drop as a percentage
  const maxVoltageDrop = (maxAllowedDrop / 100) * supplyVoltage;
  
  // Generate data points along the conductor length
  const data: VoltageProfileData[] = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= numberOfPoints; i++) {
    const distanceRatio = i / numberOfPoints;
    const distance = distanceRatio * conductorLength;
    
    // Calculate voltage at this point (assuming linear voltage drop)
    const voltageAtPoint = supplyVoltage - (voltageDrop * distanceRatio);
    
    // Check if voltage is compliant at this point
    const minimumAllowedVoltage = supplyVoltage - maxVoltageDrop;
    const isCompliant = voltageAtPoint >= minimumAllowedVoltage;
    
    data.push({
      distance,
      voltage: voltageAtPoint,
      isCompliant
    });
  }
  
  return data;
}
```

### 2. Integration with EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog

We have integrated the VoltageProfileChart into the EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog component to provide users with detailed voltage drop visualization.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Added VoltageProfileChart to the results tab
- Implemented proper data passing from voltage drop calculation results
- Added interactive features for inspecting specific points on the profile
- Ensured consistent styling with the rest of the application

**Implementation Details:**
```tsx
<Box sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
  {calculationResults && circuitData && (
    <VoltageProfileChart
      circuitData={circuitData}
      voltageDropResult={{
        ...calculationResults
      }}
      showReferenceLine={true}
      interactive={true}
      height={300}
      onPointHover={(distance, voltage) => {
        console.log(`Voltage at ${distance}m: ${voltage}V`);
      }}
    />
  )}
</Box>
```

### 3. Conductor Comparison Utilities and Chart

We have successfully implemented the conductor comparison utilities and chart components, which allow users to compare different conductor sizes and their impact on voltage drop, power loss, and costs.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-series comparison of different conductor sizes
- Economic analysis for each conductor size option
- Side-by-side comparison with key metrics
- Cost/benefit analysis with payback period calculation
- Visualization of compliant vs. non-compliant options
- Interactive selection of conductor sizes

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
export function generateConductorComparisonData(
  baseCircuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  alternativeSizes: string[] = [],
  operatingHoursPerYear: number = 2000,
  energyCostPerKwh: number = 0.12
): Record<string, ConductorComparisonData> {
  // Generate comparison data for different conductor sizes
  // Calculate voltage drop, power loss, material costs, etc.
  // Return structured data for visualization
}

export function recommendOptimalConductorSize(
  baseCircuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  operatingHoursPerYear: number = 2000,
  energyCostPerKwh: number = 0.12
): { size: string; reason: string } {
  // Find recommended conductor size based on technical and economic factors
  // Consider compliance, power loss, and economic payback period
  // Return recommendation with explanation
}
```

**Integration Details:**
```tsx
<ConductorComparisonChart
  circuitData={circuitData}
  currentConductorSize={currentSize}
  alternativeSizes={alternativeSizes}
  comparisonData={comparisonData}
  onSizeSelect={(size) => handleSizeSelect(size)}
  height={400}
/>
```

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Chart.js Integration**
   - Properly registered required plugins (annotations)
   - Implemented theme-aware styling for dark/light mode
   - Fixed event handling for newer Chart.js versions
   - Ensured proper cleanup of chart instances

2. **Type Safety**
   - Created proper interfaces for chart data and props
   - Ensured type compatibility between components
   - Fixed type issues with Chart.js configuration
   - Implemented proper event handling types
   - Fixed type errors in conductorComparisonUtils.ts by properly constructing VoltageDropInputs
   - Ensured CircuitConfiguration objects are correctly typed

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimized data generation for larger circuits
   - Implemented efficient rendering of complex charts
   - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Used type checking to catch errors at compile time

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. Circuit Diagram Visualization (2-3 days)

Now we need to create a visual circuit diagram that shows voltage drop at different points in the circuit.

**Planned Features:**
- Basic circuit schematic representation
- Color-coded voltage indicators at key points
- Component-specific tooltips with detailed information

### 2. Compliance Visualization (1-2 days)

Finally, we will enhance compliance reporting with visual indicators and direct references to relevant electrical standards.

**Planned Features:**
- Comprehensive compliance dashboard with key metrics
- Detailed references to PEC 2017 standards sections
- Visual compliance meter showing margin to limits
- Educational tooltips explaining compliance requirements

## Conclusion

The implementation of both the VoltageProfileChart and ConductorComparisonChart components represent significant progress in enhancing the visualization capabilities of our voltage drop analysis tools. These features provide users with intuitive tools for understanding voltage drop behavior and comparing different conductor options, helping them make informed decisions about circuit design and optimization.

The upcoming visualization components will further enhance this capability, providing comprehensive tools for analyzing, comparing, and optimizing electrical circuits for voltage drop compliance and economic efficiency.
