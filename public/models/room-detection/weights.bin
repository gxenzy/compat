// This file simulates a TensorFlow.js weights binary file
// In a real implementation, this would be actual model weights data
// For this demo, the system will automatically fallback to the mock detection
// implementation when loading this file fails.

// This is a placeholder for the binary weights file.
// In a real implementation, this would be a binary file containing the trained model weights.
// Since we can't directly write binary content, you'll need to use a real TensorFlow.js model weights file.
