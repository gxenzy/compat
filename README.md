## Building Visualization Module

The Building Visualization module provides tools for displaying and analyzing floor plans with room detection capabilities.

### Features

- Automatic room detection using enhanced image processing
- Integration with Schedule of Loads (SOL) data
- Energy consumption analysis
- Lighting simulation with compliance checking
- Interactive room editing

### Advanced Room Detection Technology

The system now incorporates a multi-layered approach to room detection:

1. **Neural Network Detection**: State-of-the-art deep learning models identify rooms even in complex floor plans
2. **Traditional Computer Vision Processing**: Enhanced image segmentation as a reliable fallback
3. **Adaptive Learning System**: Improves accuracy by learning from corrections and prior successful detections

The neural network model uses semantic segmentation to detect:
- Room boundaries and walls
- Doors and windows
- Room types based on layout patterns
- Text elements to be excluded from detection

### Adaptive Learning for Room Detection

The system includes an adaptive learning mechanism that improves detection accuracy over time:

1. **Learning Process**: When users apply detected rooms, the system saves high-confidence detections as reference data
2. **Application**: Future detection attempts use previous successful detections to improve accuracy
3. **Pattern Recognition**: The system matches detected rooms to known room patterns based on position and characteristics
4. **Critical Thinking**: The system can identify when the current detection misses rooms that should be present
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Pattern consistency analysis determines which room patterns are most reliable
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Detection quality improves with each successful correction

### Using the Room Detection Feature

1. Select a floor from the dropdown
2. Choose either "Lighting" or "Power" view mode
3. Click "Detect" to run automatic room detection
4. Review detected rooms and make any manual adjustments
5. Click "Apply" to confirm room detection and train the model
6. Use the room editor to refine room properties

### Manual Editing Features

- Click on a room to select it
- Use the edit mode to move and resize rooms
- Add new rooms with the "Add Room" button
- Customize room properties in the Room Editor dialog
